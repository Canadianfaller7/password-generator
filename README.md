# Random-Password-Generator

## Description
- This is a webpage where you are presented with a simple form and a generate password button and when you click on it, a series of JavaScript functions will run to get specific criteria from you on how long you want your password to be and if you want Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, Number, and or Special characters and make sure you met the minimum requirements for the password. Once that is taken in, then it will put on the screen the random password which you can then copy and use.
- As I went through this project, I was able to learn more about how to use more JavaScript functions properly and to also use the return keyword and then use the information that was returned from the other functions and plug it in as a parameter, utilize them and run through a for loop and how to get the specific information to return the randomized password back to the user.
